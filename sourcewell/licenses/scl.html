<h1>Sun Community Source License Principles</h1>

<tt>
<p>by Richard P. Gabriel and William N. Joy</p>


<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

Community Source creates a community of widely available software source code just as does
the Open Source model, but with two significant differences requested by our licensees, as follows:

<ul>
<li>compatibility among deployed versions of the software is required and enforced through testing
<li>proprietary modifications and extensions including performance improvements are allowed

</ul>

These important differences and other details make Community Source a powerful combination
of the best of the <b>proprietary licensing</b> and the more contemporary <b>open source technology licensing</b> models.

<hr>

In the contemporary world of Internet business, the traditional principles of overly protective software ownership don't make as much sense as they used to. Today it is difficult for a single company
to house all the expertise it needs to succeed. Especially when a company wishes to build infrastructure
on which other businesses depend, it cannot presume to know how best to do that right
out of the chute. The theory of separation of concerns and modularity work well once the dividing
lines are known, but finding those lines is a collaborative effort, requiring cooperation between companies.
<p>

As business practice has matured in the Internet world, it has become clear that there is good
reason to expect that companies will be able to know when to cooperate, and so
it makes sense to look at how to license software to take advantage of this emerging understanding.

<p>

The Sun Community Source License (SCSL) is designed to balance the needs of organizations
needing to innovate rapidly in order to grow with the needs of those organizations to leverage a community's expertise while maintaining proprietary advantages.

<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>

In the recent past there have been two alternative approaches to software licensing: traditional
proprietary licensing and Open Source licensing. Open Source licensing is relatively new, being preceded
by shareware and free software.

<h4>Proprietary Licensing</h4>

Proprietary licensing recognizes primarily binary use licenses which restrict software to execute-only
formats, and only those who have bought a license are entitled to use the software. In some cases,
the source to the code is available at extra charge and only for limited purposes. In this model, the
value of the software is assumed to be contained entirely within that software, and as such, it is to be
protected as dearly as any other company asset. Such a model has several advantages, as follows:
<p>

<ul>
<li>It provides protection for intellectual property.
<li>It guarantees <b>structured innovation</b>, which is innovation that is planned within a single responsible
organization.
<li>It is clear who owns what.
</ul>

<p>

On the other hand, proprietary licensing has a number of disadvantages revealed by the pace of
Internet business, as follows:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Innovation and releases are scheduled, and the schedule may be ill timed for companies that
depend on the software. Further, even when a schedule is acceptable for dependent companies,
schedules can slip.
<li>Binary-only products are classical black boxes, and the problem with a black box in an emerging
sector is that the wrong things might be in the black box: code with a wrong performance profile,
improper resource utilization, or over- or under-generalization.
<li>The quality of the software depends entirely on the owner organization; this can be a problem if
the owner organization does not place the same value on quality as the using organization, the
owner organization has a different perspective on quality, or if quality resources are not allocated
in ways that the using organization needs.
</ul>

<p>

In short, the benefits naturally fall out of the observation that proprietary software is completely
black box, and that when the boundaries of the black box are optimally placed, the benefits are clear
and effective. But if those boundaries are ill-placed or releases are ill-timed, the result is frustration
and lost opportunities.

<h4>Open Source Licensing</h4>

Open Source licensing recognizes that different organizations have different concerns, and
therefore the source code is freely available for any party to do what it will. Open Source licensing
grew out of the tradition of shareware and free software, which were movements that embodied political
beliefs about what can and cannot be owned.

<p>
Open Source licensing, on the other hand, does not embody beliefs about ownership aside from
recognizing the fact that some organizations wish to own software and others don't.  However, Open Source licensing does recognize that certain common elements - for example, infrastructure - are important for a number of parties and that those elements should be freely and openly available.
<p>

With Open Source licensing, the source code is available for any use, but there are incentives to "give back" to the Open Source community those improvements that are for the common good. Most
importantly, the Open Source approach recognizes that the primary value of a piece of software is the
expertise represented by the people who developed it. Thus, even when source is out in the open, the
value still remains with those who can expertly manipulate it.
<p>
Such a model has several advantages, as follows:
<ul>
<li>The code is open with published and, often, specified interfaces.
<li>There are more developers looking and working on the common source code, so there is higher
quality and more-rapid innovation.
<li>There is no central owning organization that sets schedules and priorities that might conflict with
a using organization's schedules and priorities.
<li>There is a self-organizing effect in which the boundaries between proprietary concerns and community
concerns are adaptively set.
<li>A participating organization can reap the benefits of expertise not in its employ.
</ul>
<p>
There are disadvantages as well, as follows:

<ul>
<li>There is no clear control over compatibility issues and there may, therefore, be fragmentation.
<li>There may be no responsible organization. Bugs introduced by another organization may be too
difficult for a using organization to fix and of too low priority for the author to fix in a timely
manner.
<li>Progress can be chaotic and undirected.
<li>There are limited financial incentives for improvements and innovations, leading commercial
developers to use the proprietary model.
</ul>

<h3>Community Source License</h3>

The Community Source licensing model takes the advantages from each of the proprietary and
Open Source models and eliminates the disadvantages.
<p>

In Community Source licensing there is a community of common interests centered around an
infrastructure which is provided by a particular organization, called the developing organization. A
group of other organizations may join the community, and generally those organizations will have an
interest in building businesses around the infrastructure.

<p>

For example, Jini<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP> connection technology licensing is based on a community of companies who wish to build
and sell devices employing Jini technology. Sun Microsystems is the developing organization which invented, designed, and
built the initial Jini technology infrastructure. This infrastructure is network based and provides a mechanism
for devices and software services to gather into a spontaneous network of capabilities.

<p>

The community comprises those who have agreed to the license, and within this community
there is a mostly Open Source model of interaction. However, because the members of the community
are bound by a common license, intellectual property is maintained and there is no requirement
to share openly everything developed for the infrastructure. Moreover, the community comprises
only those who have agreed to the license, not the general public.
<p>

Three levels of participation in the license can be supported, as follows:

<ul>
<li>Research Use, which is not only for real research - for example, to improve the infrastructure - but for evaluating the technology and prototyping potential products.
<li>Internal Deployment, which is both for (very) limited distribution and for testing before launching
a product.
<li>Commercial Use, which is for selling products.
</ul>

<h4>Principles</h4>

The following summarizes the principles behind the design of the Sun Community Source License.

<p>

<b>Immediate, Open Access</b><br>
In order to encourage members to join the community defined by the license, there is an easy and
risk-free way for a company to get access to the infrastructure source code. Any company or developer
can become a Research Use licensee with a simple click-through license which grants broad experimentation
and evaluation rights. The licensee may use the source code and its specifications in any
way whatsoever short of deployment.
<p>
With a Research Use license, a developer may take any approach to using the source code in order
to determine whether the technology can be of use; in fact, the developer can do all the work
leading up to deployment with such a license.
<p>
The license and source code are available through the Net, and so the transition from interest to
participation is immediate. Access is clearly open.

<p>

<b>Increased Innovation</b><br>
In order to increase the rate of innovation, improvements and additions to the original source
code may be incorporated into the source code regardless of where they come from. There are two
basic types of source code improvements that can be made: improvements to the core technology and
improvements or additions to surrounding technology. With Jini connection technology, for instance, there is
the basic infrastructure and there are services. Each sort of service - storage services, for example - will have common elements which can be improved by community efforts. In this case, acceptable
modifications and additions are determined by the subcommunity of organizations who are working
in that area using an open process. In such cases it is expected that change can be very rapid, and indeed,
must be in order to gain widespread agreement and deployment.
<p>

With infrastructure modifications and additions, change is expected to be less rapid because the
base of organizations that depend on that infrastructure is large. However, because developers at organizations
with different requirements are working with the core technology, over time it is expected
that situations will arise that the original developers did not anticipate. These outside developers
are able to evolve the technology for their products and markets more rapidly than the original developers
would ordinarily be able to do using a traditional proprietary license.
<p>
In short, there is a spectrum from the innermost portions of the infrastructure where change
should be slow and deliberate to the outermost portions - which might represent applications - where change should be as rapid as the market requires.

<p>

<b>Increased Work Force</b><br>
In order to increase the effective work force, participation is not limited: Any organization can
participate in the Research Use License without paying or negotiation.

<p>

<b>Increased Quality</b><br>
Simply stated, with more eyes looking at the code, there is more chance that errors will be caught
and repaired, particularly when that code is used in situations and contexts not anticipated by the
original developers and researchers. It might be thought that with an Open-source type of model
there would be increased likelihood of errors in code, but the Open Source experience is largely the opposite - that because the source is published, developers are generally very careful while developing
code in order to avoid public embarrassment.
<p>
Moreover, the test code is also covered by the license, and the benefits of a larger community
working accrue to the test suite as well as to the target technology.
<p>

<b>Faster Commercialization</b><br>
The Internal Deployment License makes the transition to commercial use easy. Once the technology
has been evaluated and adapted through the Research License it can be deployed internally by
conforming to the related test suites and specifications. In some cases we expect that Internal Deployment
will be allowed without a fee, as it is for the core of the Jini connection technology. The Internal Deployment
License is made available with the Research Use License, which means it is also immediate
and easy.
<p>
The Commercial License is tailored to provide a dependable platform for all third parties and to provide revenues to the developing
organization, which can be used to fund both support for the entire community of licensees and
also further development.
<p>

<b>Access to Students</b><br>
Researchers, teachers, and their students are particularly attuned to using technology at its limits,
and therefore such people are especially encouraged to participate by special conditions of the
SCSL. It is easy to use the source code in laboratories and in the classroom.
<p>

<b>Protection for Intellectual Property</b><br>
Licensees rightly enter into the community expecting that their intellectual property rights will
be respected. Therefore it is not required that a participant give up intellectual property rights when
joining the community. In order that the community remain open, however, the SCSL does require
that any programming interfaces which extend the platform or infrastructure technology be open
and specified, even while implementations and intellectual property embedded in the implementations
may be held proprietary.

<h4>The Best of Both Worlds</h4>

The Sun Community Source License blends the best aspects of the proprietary and Open
Source license models. The SCSL was designed to support a developing organization and a surrounding
community of participants. The developing organization is generally building an infrastructure
that will spawn a number of new marketplaces or business opportunities for the community of participants.
The developing organization might itself act also as an ordinary participant in the community
if, for example, that organization desires to take advantage of a new marketplace or business
opportunity. Nevertheless, the two roles are separated in the SCSL. The developing organization deserves
to reap some benefits for developing the infrastructure, and the SCSL recognizes that.
<p>

The following lists the benefits of the SCSL that are shared with or derived from the proprietary
model:
<p>

<ul>
<li>It provides protection for intellectual property.<p>
While error corrections to the licensed technology must be given back to the community, other
modifications can remain proprietary at the discretion of the participating organization that created
them.
<p>
<li>It guarantees structured innovation within a single responsible organization.<p>
The developing organization is responsible for the original code base and the community is
responsible for the contributed portions. Ultimately, the developing organization is responsible
for the entire source code base including moving it forward.
<p>
<li>It is clear who owns what.<p>
The infrastructure part of the original code and upgrades to it are owned by the developing organization
and shared with the community. Error corrections are required to be given back to the
community by all licensees. Community members may contribute shared modifications to the
community, granting rights to the community to use these modifications, including intellectual
property, specifications, and test suites.
<p>
Licensees may make modifications, such as performance enhancements or platform adaptations
which are compatible with the licensed technology, or make extensions - these modifications and
extensions may be kept proprietary, though extensions are required to have open interfaces.
<p>
<li>There is clear control over compatibility.<p>
For the infrastructure part of the original code and upgrades to it, the developing organization
provides specifications and test suites. These test suites must be passed by all internally distributed
code. Commercial distributions have an additional requirement to use relatively recent
upgraded code and pass these test suites, so that the platform can evolve.
<p>
For extensions, the community member making the extension is required to supply specifications
and, ultimately, test suites.
</ul>
<p>

In some cases neither a test suite nor a good specification may be good enough to guarantee that a
modification, extension, or bug fix is compatible. For some purposes a <b>reference implementation</b> can provide not only a base on which to build a commercial version of a specified piece of functionality
but a guide to ensure correctness. Although the SCSL does not mention reference
implementations per se, reference implementations as part of a process of defining and accepting
specifications for interfaces, for example, are compatible with the SCSL principles and philosophy.
<p>
Benefits SCSL shares with or are dervied from the Open Source model are as follows:
<p>

<ul>
<li>The platform is open with published and specified interfaces.<p>
The SCSL recognizes the strong community interest in an open platform. A primary mechanism
for extension within the community is publishing the specifications for new and often layered
interfaces. These interfaces may be best - or in rare cases, only - implemented by using proprietary
techniques and technology; this is permitted, but under the SCSL, the programming interfaces
themselves and related specifications and test suites must be open.
<p>
<li>There are more developers looking and working on the common source code, so there is higher
quality and more-rapid innovation.<p>
The community pulls organizations and developers into a circle of shared concerns, and this community
can effectively self-organize with only a little assistance from the developing organization.
<p>
<li>There is no central owning organization that sets schedules and priorities that might conflict with
a using organization's schedules and priorities.<p>
Though there is a schedule for the developing organization's structured innovation, the SCSL
provides every participant with all the freedom and authority to move forward independently.
<p>
<li>There is a self-organizing effect in which the boundaries between proprietary concerns and community
concerns are adaptively set.<p>
There is a force tending to keep the infrastructure stable because all the participants depend on it,
but innovation can take place any place in the technology base. The binding requirements of the
SCSL such as openness and compatibility also tend to keep the infrastructure stable by preventing
predatory modifications and extensions.
<p>
There is also a spectrum of concerns from the developing organization's point of view that ranges
from extensions of high importance to those of less importance; by initiating work for those high
importance items itself, the developing organization can exert beneficial stability on them.
<p>

<li>A participating organization can reap the benefits of expertise not in its employ.<p>
There is no limit on who can participate.
</ul>
<p>

Additional benefits to the SCSL are as follows:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Proprietary modifications including performance improvements are allowed.
<p>
Unlike the proprietary licensing model, all community members can make such changes to the
original source base (or upgrades to it) because they have access to it. Unlike the Open Source
model, such changes are not required to be given back to the community, though it is encouraged.
(Note however, that error corrections to the original source code base must always be returned to
the community.)
<p>

<li>Innovation and releases are not subject to a centrally planned schedule.
<p>
Each participating organization may innovate or release at any time with any combination of private
and community sources. In order to ensure that other independent releases are compatible, a
conformance suite must be passed before release, and published specifications must be respected.
For simplicity, any necessary testing and certification can be performed by the releasing participant.
<p>
<li>The quality of the software can be improved throughout the community.<p>
Each participant can determine appropriate quality levels and work toward them independent of
any other participant or in conjunction with others.
<p>
<li>Progress is always made on the original source base, and progress on the peripheries depends on
participant needs.
<p>
The original source base is fully the responsibility of the developing organization which can move
that base forward; the community may participate in those activities, accelerating them as necessary.
Because commercial users of the technology are required to update to newer base technology
in new products, after a reasonable delay, the platform can evolve.
<p>
As interest builds in creating related technologies, those parts can move ahead at their own pace.
<p>
<li>There is a place for both incremental improvment and reward for invention.
<p>
Not only does the developing organization have sufficient motivation to invent and innovate but
for participating community members there are incentives to invent in the marketplace and protections
for those inventions within the community. That is, by creating a more protected community
than a completely public one, there can be protections tuned to encourage and safeguard
innovation and invention within that community.

</ul>

<h3>Effects</h3>

In the last few years there have been remarkable changes in the computer industry largely
spurred by the Internet, the Web, and by alternative forms of business. For the first time we have
seen business strategies based on giving away products as rapidly as possible, we've seen Open Source
gain a large measure of success, and we've seen collaboration where common interests play a stronge role.
<p>
There are many benefits to the sort of license the Community Source License represents. The
following sections talk about them a bit.

<h4>Increased Commitment</h4>
One of the difficulties of trying to get a new infrastructure technology adopted is the sense that a
proprietary standard might not make it or that a competitive situation will make choosing it difficult
or impossible. Regardless of who the sponsoring company is, there is a risk associated with not
knowing everything.
<p>

Because participants in the Community Source License have access to the source code and can
reasonably expect that their innovations will appear in that source, those participants can see everything there is to see about the technology. By being part of a community of partners, the risk of putting
all one's eggs in a single company's basket is reduced. The SCSL creates a context in which
commitment is less risky, and the more participants there are, the less risky it is.

<h4>Closer Ties Between Development Groups</h4>

Developers have always gotten together at conferences and coffee houses, and when they do they
are very good at two things: exchanging useful information in the form of techniques and know-how, and not revealing secrets. When developers get together within the community created by the SCSL,
they are able to speak freely about particular issues represented by the shared source code. Thus,
beneficial information exchange can take place more rapidly, and each participating organization benefits - because writing software is hard.

<h4>Rapid Spread of Influence</h4>
Because it is so easy for a participant to join the community and because there is a shared commitment
to the technology once participants are fully engaged, the underlying infrastructure is
spread more rapidly. And because there are more development groups pushing up both the innovation
and quality, the new marketplace based on the infrastructure is created more rapidly than it
would any other way.

<h4>Reduced Risk for Adopters</h4>

Frequently, black-box technology products pose too great a risk for many organizations because
those organizations end up depending on another company for the development, maintenance, and
evolution of parts of their own products. Most importantly, the priorities the owner company would
assign to work related to the technology are not necessarily priorities a customer would choose. With
SCSL, the participants share common source code and can set their own priorities, working as much
or as little on the code as they wish.
<p>

Those organizations that require more infrastructure can take it from a platform provider
as usual just as some organizations prefer to buy from Red Hat rather than getting Linux from an
ftp site.

<h3>The Future</h3>

In writers' workshops, in design charrettes, in code reviews and walkthroughs, and in artists' studios
there is one common theme: By working within a community, a better result is achieved than
working alone - even virtuosos learned by criticism and sharing. And if you talk to almost any artist
or software developer, you will hear that what they are doing is a "work in progress."
<p>
In defining the Sun Community Source License, Sun has tried very hard to get it right, but maybe it isn't perfect.  Naturally, we believe so much in our open process that the license itself is subject to
that same process, and as participants need changes in the license, we will make them.
<p>
Right now, in the context of an industry rapidly changing, it's our best attempt - it's a work in progress.
