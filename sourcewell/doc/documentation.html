<A NAME="about">
<P CLASS="subtitle">0. About this manual

<p>This documentation is not up-to-date. It should give more an idea of what SourceWell can than the current status of the project. If you have questions about the current SourceWell version, please contact with the authors.

<P>This manual has been made with the idea of covering as many aspects of
SourceWell as possible. If you are a user who's only aim is to install
and use the SourceWell system, you may not have to read it
as a whole as advanced features for developers are
also explained.

<p>SourceWell 1.0.12 is a development version. It is the first step towards the new architecture that will arise with SourceWell 2. There are no feature enhancements towards SourceWell's 1.0.9 version, but some bugs (one big security bug and another memory bug) were fixed. Backwards compatibility with SourceWell 1.0.9 has been mantained. We expect that SourceWell's development will acquire lots of new features with the new architecture.

<A NAME="introduction">
<P CLASS="subtitle">2. Introduction

<P>SourceWell is a highly configurable, well documented software announcement and retrieval system entirely writen in <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP3</a> and database independent. It includes user authentication and autherization system (anonymous/user/editor/admin), sessions with and without cookies, high configurability, multilangual support, ease of administration, RDF-type document backend, several graphical statistics, announcing mailing lists, application indexing by sections, installation support and many other useful features.

<P>SourceWell depends on the <a href="http://phplib.netuse.de/" target="_blank">PHPLib library</a> (version 7.2d). Only if you want to have diary and weekly mailing lists with the announcements, you should also have Mailman installed in your box.

<P>You can see a fully working example of the SourceWell system at BerliOS
SourceWell by visiting <a href="http://sourcewell.berlios.de" target="_blank">http://sourcewell.berlios.de</a>. A close look at it will show you what
you can do with SourceWell. BerliOS SourceWell has at this moment more
than 1500 applications inserted and has been the main reason for making this software.

<P>BerliOS SourceWell is part of the BerliOS project at GMD FOKUS. Please, have
a look at <a href="http://www.berlios.de" target="_blank">http://www.berlios.de</a> for further information. At this moment, BerliOS also has other services: <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/" target="_blank">BerliOS Developer</a> (a SourceForge clone), <a href="http://news.berlios.de" target="_blank">BerliOS News</a> (news about Open Source - in German) and <a href="http://sourcebiz.berlios.de" target="_blank">SourceBiz</a> (a directory with Open Source companies, services, products and solutions - in German).

<P>You can always download the latest version of SourceWell at:

<A NAME="installation">
<P CLASS="subtitle">3. Installation

<P>Important note about security:
<UL>
<LI>SourceWell's main directory and all its subdirectories are not protected in
any way by us! Please make sure that you can put propperly <I>.htaccess</I>
files in these directories (especially the include subdirectory). If someone
is able to read the local.inc file in the include
directory, operator (user name) and password for your database could be known and
misused. For further information about <I>.htaccess</I> look at the Apache's documentation.
</UL>

<A NAME="fast_installation">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">3.1 Fast installation (for MySQL)

<P>You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache), PHP3,
PHPLib and MySQL installed in your system. Mailman is only needed if you want
to use mailing lists.

<UL>
<LI>user$ mysql -h <I>host</I> -u <I>database_superuser</I> -p
<BR>(insert <I>superuser_password</I>)
<LI>mysql> USE mysql;
<LI>mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( '<I>host</I>', '<I>operator</I>',
PASSWORD('<I>operator_password</I>'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
<LI>mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
<LI>mysql> CREATE DATABASE sourcewell;
<LI>mysql> exit;
<LI>user$ tar -zxvf sourcewell-1.0.12.tar.gz
<LI>user$ mysql -h <I>host</I> -u <I>operator</I> -p < sourcewell/sql/mysql.sql
<BR>(insert the <I>operator_password</I>)
<LI>user$ vi sourcewell/include/local.inc
<BR>(insert the correct database parameters; please, keep <I>sourcewell</I>
as the database name)
<PRE>
   var $Host     = "<I>host</I>";
   var $Database = "sourcewell";
   var $User     = "<I>operator</I>";
   var $Password = "<I>password</I>";
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
SourceWell. Start your browser and visit <I>
http://yourserver/sourcewell/index.php3</I>. If you get an error message or you have the impression that the system does not work correctly, have a look at this page <I>http://yourserver/sourcewell/test.php3</I>. It will give you some hints on where SourceWell may be failing.

<P>If everything looks ok, great! As you'll see in the index page, the SourceWell system comes with some inserted example applications and licenses. You can
delete or modify them by entering as an administrator. To do so, login
as the default administrator with user,editor,admin permissions. At the prompt use the following ID to login (case sensitive):
<PRE>
        Username: <I>oldfish</I>
	Password: <I>oldfish</I>
</PRE>

<P>Very important: Be sure of inmediately changing the login and password by
clicking on the <I>User Admin</I> link. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)

<P>If things do not work, maybe you'll have to read the whole
installation chapter :-(.

<p>Future versions of SourceWell will work with GNU gettext and we are looking forward to avoiding this large amount of memory.

<A NAME="before_starting">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">3.2. Before starting

<P>You've got to look if your web server is correctly configurated and running. That means that:

<UL>
<LI>The web server is capable of recognising and executing PHP3 scripts in user directories
<LI>PHP is compliled to work with the MySQL database
</UL>

<P>Please, attend to the respective manuals and documentation for a propper installation.

<A NAME="phplib">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">3.2.1. About PHPLib

<P>For a correct functioning of SourceWell, PHPLib has to be installed. PHPLib
is an usefull library which permits SourceWell to have sessions,
authentication and in future versions database independence. PHPLib is
published under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL). For more information about PHPLib follow this link: <a href="http://phplib.netuse.de/" target="_blank">http://phplib.netuse.de/</a>.

<P>SourceWell has been developed with the 7.2d version of PHPLib, which
can be downlodaded from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/phplib/phplib-7.2d.tar.gz">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/phplib/phplib-7.2d.tar.gz</a>. As SourceWell strictly
uses the API given by PHPLib, future versions of PHPLib should also
work without problem. It is important to note that version 7.2c of the PHPLib library had a security bug that was fixed in the recommended version. So, if you have got this version installed in your box, please update as soon as possible.

<P>Please read carefully the documentation provided for PHPLib for a
successfull installation. The installation of PHPLib is sufficient;
you don't need to know more about PHPLib and its functioning for
using the SourceWell system.


<P>BerliOS SourceWell entry for the PHPLib library: <a href="http://sourcewell.berlios.de/appbyid.php3?id=350" target="_blank">http://sourcewell.berlios.de/appbyid.php3?id=350</a>.

<p>New versions of SourceWell provide a test script (test.php3) which you can run in order to see if your installation is ok. If not, please follow the described instructions carefully.

<A NAME="database_installation">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">3.2.2. About the Database

<P>The next step is to install and configure the database
system. SourceWell has been tested with MySQL, so that the following
explanations are to be followed with that RDBMS. For other systems,
the philosophy will be the same, but you will have to particularize
the instructions.

<P>You can download MySQL from:
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/downloads</a>.


<P>1. Install and configure the RDBMS

<P>2. Create the user SourceWell needs:
   <UL>
   <LI>Login as MySQL's superuser (<I>host</I> should be <I>localhost</I> in
   the default case)
   <BR>user$ mysql -h <I>host</I> -u <I>database_superuser</I> -p
   <BR>(insert <I>superuser_password</I>)
   <LI>Choose the mysql database
   <BR>(that's where the database users and their privileges are)
   <BR>mysql> USE mysql;
   <LI>Insert an operator user for sourcewell, its password and its privileges
   <BR>mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( '<I>host</I>', '<I>operator</I>',
PASSWORD('<I>operator_password</I>'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
   <LI>"Commit" the changes
   <BR>mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   </UL>

<P>3. Create the data base:
   <UL>
   <LI>Create the data base (with sourcewell as its name; see note below)
   <BR>mysql> CREATE DATABASE sourcewell;
   <LI>Exit MySQL
   <BR>mysql> exit;
   </UL>

<P>Note: It is important for having a simple configuration of the system to name this database
"sourcewell". A different database name would imply editing and modifying many
of the
default configuration parameters in the local.inc file, which is not recommended.

<A NAME="mailman">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">3.2.3. About Mailman

<P>Only if you want to have diary and weekly mailing lists with the announcements, you should also have Mailman installed in your box. You can find more information about Mailman in its official GNU homepage: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html</a>.

<A NAME="file_extraction">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">3.4. File extraction

<P>Due to security reasons you should not install or execute SourceWell
as root. It's not even necessary.

<P>The installation process is as following:

<OL>
<LI>choose the parent directory where you want sourcewell to be and cd into it
<LI>verify that the user public_html exists and is accesible from the
web
<LI>uncompress SourceWell in the parent directory
<BR>user$ tar -zvxf sourcewell-1.0.12.tar.gz
<LI>List the content of the directories. You should have a directory
sourcewell with five subdirectories. Read chapter 7 of this documentation for further information
about the files.
<BR>user$ ls -R
<LI>create the database structures in the database
<BR>user$ mysql -h <I>host</I> -u <I>operator</I> -p < sourcewell/sql/mysql.sql
<BR>(insert the <I>operator_password</I>)
</OL>

<A NAME="configuration_and_personalization">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">3.5. Configuration and personalization

<P>The database configuration has to be done in config.inc and local.inc; both are in the
include directory. Please, at this point read another time the security
note given at the beginning of chapter 3.

<UL>
<LI>user$ vi sourcewell/include/local.inc
<BR>(insert the correct database parameters; please, keep <I>sourcewell</I>
as the database name)
<PRE>
   var $Host     = "<I>host</I>";
   var $Database = "sourcewell";
   var $User     = "<I>operator</I>";
   var $Password = "<I>password</I>";
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>If you want to personalize SourceWell, you will have to edit the
config.inc file in the include directory. The configuration file is
carefully commented; please, take your time for configuring the SourceWell system right.

<p>Note: we are trying to make configuration easier in next versions by allowing to do it through a web browser.

<P>Congratulations, you've finished installing and configuring SourceWell. Start your browser and visit http://yourserver/sourcewell/index.php3. If you get an error message or you have the impression that the system does not work correctly, have a look at this page <I>http://yourserver/sourcewell/test.php3</I>. It will give you some hints on where SourceWell may be failing.

<P>If everything looks ok, great! As you'll see, the SourceWell system comes with some inserted example applications and licenses. You
can delete or modify them by entering as an administrator. To do so, login as the
default administrator with <I>user,editor,admin</I> permissions.
At the prompt use the following ID to login (case sensitive):
<PRE>
        Username: <I>oldfish</I>
	Password: <I>oldfish</I>
</PRE>

<P>Vert important: Be sure of inmediately changing the login and password by
clicking on the link <I>User Admin</I>. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)

<A NAME="functionality">
<P CLASS="subtitle">4. Main Functionality

<P>While there are basic activities (looking for applications, viewing
statistics, etc.) that are open to everybody, SourceWell provides
authorisation for advanced purposes.

<P>Note: In the following, we are going to talk about the default permission configuration of the system (which is also the recommended setting). With SourceWell 1.0a, the permission configuration has been implemented to be changed dinamically, so that the site administrator can easily modify the permissions needed at his will from the include/config.inc file.

<P>Authorisation is based on registration. The SourceWell system has two sets of users: unregistered users and registered users. Between registered
users we have different permission levels:
        <UL>
	<li>anonymous, which is a very special user as we will see later
	<LI>user, which can insert and update applications and write comments on them
	<LI>editor, who is responsible for the application administration
	<LI>admin, who is responsible for the administration of users, sections and categories, comments, licences and the mailing lists.
        </UL>
<P>Permissions are independent and do not have to be
unique for a certain registered user. That means that a registered
user with only administrator permissions is not allowed to perform
actions that are restricted to registered users with editor or user permissions, but a single registered user can have user, editor and
administration permissions.

<P>Each level of authorisation comprises certain actions that are listed below. Again, we want the reader to notice, that this is the default configuration. The administrator can change it at his will at the include/config.inc file:

<P>Unregistered users can:
        <UL>
	<LI>Retrieve software applications
	<LI>View the comments on applications
	<LI>Read the FAQ
	<LI>Choose language
	<LI>Login
	<LI>Obtain the forgotten password
	<LI>Become authorised user by entering a form
	<LI>Look at the different licences listed in SourceWell
	<LI>Read the XML Backend
	<LI>Search for applications
	<LI>See applications' developers
	<LI>Join the weekly or daily mailing lists
	<LI>View the advanced graphical statistics
        </UL>

<P>SourceWell has an anonymous user with <I>anonymous</I> permission that is able to:
        <UL>
        <LI>Do everything what unregistered user can do
	<LI>Insert and update applications (inserted applications have a "pending" status until they are reviewed by an editor)
	<LI>Write comments
        </UL>

<P>Registered users with <I>user</I> permission can:
	<UL>
        <LI>Do everything what unregistered user can do
        <LI>Insert and update applications (inserted applications have a "pending" status until they are reviewed by an editor)
	<LI>Write comments
	<LI>Change their user registration data
        <LI>See a list of the system users
        </UL>

<P>Editors (<I>editor</I> permission) are able to:
        <UL>
        <LI>Do everything what unregistered users can do
	<LI>Review pending applications (inserted or updated by registered users)
	<LI>Change application insertions
	<LI>Delete and undelete applications
	<LI>See changed or modified applications (applications that are
	affected when sections, categories or
	licenses are deleted or modified by an <I>administrator</I>) and change their status
        </UL>

<P>Administrators (<I>admin</I> permission) are able to:
        <UL>
        <LI>Do everything what unregistered users can do
	<LI>Administrate users and their permissions
	<LI>Administrate (insert, rename and delete) sections
	<LI>Administrate (insert, rename and delete) categories
	<LI>Administrate (insert, rename, change URL and delete) licenses
	<LI>Administrate (modify and delete) comments
	<LI>Check the date integrity of applications in the database
	<LI>View the daily and weekly newsletter
	<LI>Send the daily and weekly newsletter at any time
	<LI>Decide if there can be an anonymous user in the system or not
        </UL>
 
<P>As explained before, SourceWell's registered users can have several
roles. So it is possible (and recommendable) that editors (<I>editor</I>) have also <I>user</I>
permissions and that administrators (<I>admin</I>) have also <I>user</I> and <I>editor</I> permissions. This becomes even more important if you personalize the permissions of your system in the include/config.inc file as you can only choose one permission type at a time (whether <I>user</I>, <I>editor</I>, <I>admin</I> or <I>all</I>) for every type of functionality.

<P>If the system administrator wants, the system can have anonymous users. Consequently, visitors do not have to be registered, but can post new applications, changes and comments. There can only be one anonymous user in the system and this user can only have <I>anonymous</I> permission; if you don't want to have one, just delete the user with <I>anonymous</I> permission in the <I>admuser.php3</I> file (there you can also change its username and its password if you want). The SourceWell system automatically shows an information box at the login screen announcing that the visitor can login as anonymous if an user with <I>anonymous</I> permission exists.

<P>&nbsp;
<A NAME="international">
<P CLASS="subtitle">5. International support

<P>SourceWell can be easily translated into different
languages. If you see that SourceWell does not have support in your
language, you're gladly invited to help us with the
internationalization of SourceWell by sending us your translation.

<P>You don't need to have any computer or programming experience to do a
translation. Keep on reading and you'll find out how easy it is.

<p>Note: future versions will have i18n support through gettext and i12n through po files. We are on it.

<A NAME="normal_outputs">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">5.1. Main outputs

<P>Download the lang-translate.inc file (it also comes in SourceWell's
1.0.12 tarball) . If you edit it, you'll find lines
like this:

<PRE>
     case "Home": $tmp = ""; break;
</PRE>

<P>We will explain it briefly: after the <I>case</I> you will see the English text to translate writen in
quotes (in our example, the English text is "Home"). Then you'll find a
sort of equation. The content of your translation from English into your language should
be placed in between these second quotes. For example, in the case you were making a translation into German, this would be the result for this line:

<PRE>
     case "Home": $tmp = "Heim"; break;
</PRE>

<P>Ok, now that you're an expert, you'll notice that "Home" is translated
into German as "Heim" ;-). The procedure just explained should be repeated with
all the lines in this file. 

<P>Once you're finished, save it as <I>YourLanguage-lang.inc</I> and please send it to the authors. We will include
it in the next releases so that everybody can benefit of your work.

<A NAME="faq_file">

<A NAME="statistics">
<P CLASS="subtitle">6. Statistics

<P>As we were doing SourceWell, we felt that we could use our database to know
more about what Open Source software is and means. We did not only want to know
which are the most popular Open Source applications, we also wanted to do
research on licenses, developers, desktops... the statistics were born.

<P>The statistics are also thought to be a procedure to do a sort of fast
checking on your SourceWell system. The <I>number of applications added or modified
in the last week</I> and the <I>number of pending applications</I> are the best
examples of this idea. Maybe more statistics of this type are added in the future.

<P>Any feedback you might have on this topic is always welcome.

<P Class=authors>R: Registered user (<I>admin</I>, <I>editor</I> or <I>user</I> permission)
<BR>U: <I>User</I> permission needed
<BR>C: Configurable through the configuration file

<P>With SourceWell 1.0a, the permissions needed to access certain pages can be configurated dinamically from the include/config.inc file. This allows to set the permission to <I>admin</I>, <I>editor</I>, <I>user</I> or even <I>all</I> (with the <I>all</I> option, everybody is able to access that page) at your wish. Please, be aware that the security of your system depends on what you decide; be sure of what you are doing! The default values are the recommended ones. At this moment, the only possibility for configuring permissions is by editing the include/config.inc file, but future versions of SourceWell may allow you to administrate this permissions through the web.

<P>The decision about allowing an anonymous user (whose login and password are known) is taken by the <I>admin</I> by creating an user in the admuser.php3 page with unique <I>anonymous</I> permission. The SourceWell systems comes with an anonymous user by default, whose login is <I>anonymous</I> and password is <I>anonymous</I>. If you don't want to have anonymous contributions to your system, just delete the user with this right.
<P>Note: Be carefull when deleting users. All their contributions to the system will be lost. If you have an anonymous user in your system, whenever you delete an user all its contributions will have been posted as "anonymous". If you do not have one, they are kept in the database, but they cannot be recovered! (it is a bug we will have to fix).

<P>A registered user with <I>admin</I> permission can administrate through the web
this table by adding, modifying or deleting sections and/or categories. For
section administration the URL to visit is http://yourserver/admsec.php3. The page for

<p>Table temp has been added in SourceWell 1.0.12 in order to avoid that false insertions delete previous insertions. Hence, all applications that are already in the database and are going to be updated by visitors with permissions different from editor and administrator permission. The pending state of these applications is stored in the temp table. Once these contents are validated, they are moved from this table into the software table.

<A NAME="developers">
<P CLASS="subtitle">9. For developers

<P>SourceWell is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.

<P>The next paragrahps have been made with the idea of a developer who wants to
make further development in SourceWell or who wants to make some
modifications so that SourceWell suits his needs.

<P>Note: PHP knowledge is needed for developing or modifying SourceWell. You should also have
certain SQL experience if you want to handle with databases.

<P>SourceWell has been thought as an announcement and retrieval system
for software, but maybe you're interested in adapting SourceWell for
announcing other kind of things. Or maybe you want to improve
SourceWell adding features or correcting errors. If one of these is your case, keeping on
reading will be of interest for you.

<P>Please report to the authors any adaptions and/or modifications. This
could help us knowing what SourceWell should implement in the future
and making other SourceWell users benefit from your work.

<P>For advanced uses, PHPLib should also be known. You can read about
PHPLib's API in PHPLib's manual. PHPLib is used for sessions, authentication and for the database access. It is very important to understand its functions to achieve a propper comprehension of the SourceWell system.

<A NAME="source_contribution">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">9.1. Source contribution

<P> If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
 information:
<UL>
<LI>All configuration data belongs to config.inc. The local.inc file
   just is the local configuration for the PHPLib library. Please keep it free from other code.
<LI>Commonly used functions should be added to lib.inc.
<LI>Functions that refer to statistics belong to statslib.inc.
<LI>Functions that are used for comments should be placed at
   cmtlib.inc.
<LI>Functions that handle boxes have to be inserted in box.inc.
<LI>Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But please
   try to keep your code as simple as possible.
<LI>Please, try to write all your outputs in English with the translate
   function (explained later). This will help to keep the
   internationalization of this project clear.
<LI>If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the ChangeLog.
</UL>

<P>Important: With SourceWell version 1.0, development has switched to CVS.
  The following method (anonymous CVS access) is preferred for new developers. The module you wish to check out must be specified as the <I>modulename</I>. When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the <I>Enter</I> key:
<UL>
<LI>Fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
<BR>user$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/csroot/sourcewell login
<BR>[Password: <I>(just press <I>Enter</I> if you are an anonymous user)</I>]
<BR>user$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/sourcewell co <I>modulename</I>
<BR>[Updates from within the module's directory do not need the -d parameter]
<LI>send us the file you've modified, or send us a diff.
</UL>

<P> We've also set up CVSWEB on <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=23" target="_blank">http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=23</a>.

<P> Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have already
  contributed something useful to SourceWell.  If you're interested in that,
  please contact the authors.

<A NAME="structure_of_a_page">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">9.2. Main structure of a page

<P>Explaining how most of SourceWell files
are structured is important for developers in order to rapidly know what is
coded and how it has been done. Afterwards adaptions and modifications are made more easily.

<UL>
<LI>Starting (loading) session:
<PRE>
  page_open(array("sess" => "SourceWell_Session"));
</PRE>

<P>This is a function provided by PHPLib which allows to have sessions
with and without cookies enabled in the visitor's browser. It should
be placed at the top of every page and before any other output.

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Authentication

<P>There are two different types of authentication depending on the page
visited.

<P>Case a: authenticated and not authenticated visitors (both type of users can
access the current page)

<PRE>
    if (isset($auth) && !empty($auth->auth["perm"])) {
      page_close();
      page_open(array("sess" => "SourceWell_Session",
                      "auth" => "SourceWell_Auth",
                      "perm" => "SourceWell_Perm"));
    }
</PRE>

<P>In the first case, everybody can visit that web page without
having logged in. What the code does is looking if the user is
authenticated; if it is so, a new session with his parameters is
loaded (the default one is closed with the page_close() function
given by PHPLib). Loading of sessions is done by means of PHPLib.

<P>This type of authentication should be the default one. The SourceWell system
needs sessions to led PHPLib work with databases that are not in the local
host. That's why even if sessions are not necessary for a certain page, they
should be inserted to ensure a correct functioning of the system.

<P>Case b: authenticated users only

<PRE>
    page_open(array("sess" => "SourceWell_Session",
                    "auth" => "SourceWell_Auth",
                    "perm" => "SourceWell_Perm"));
</PRE>

<P>This page requires to be logged in. At this point it doesn't matter
what permissions the registered user has. If the visitor is not logged in, the
login-page (loginform.ihtml) will be automatically called by means of PHPLib's functionality.

<P>So far, we haven't looked if the page visited requires
any special permission. This will be done later in the page and won't be realized by PHPLib; the
developer will have to make an if-statement with the required permissions and allow the user to access the
content of the page or prompt an error box.

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Header

<P>The include/header.inc file contains the common functions and
initializations almost all SourceWell pages require. What the header inserts in
each file is:

<UL>
<P>&nbsp;<LI>Disabling cache
<PRE>
  header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");
  header("Pragma: no-cache");
</PRE>

<P>This disables the browsers to catch our web pages in the local cache. If we
wouldn't do cache cleaning, just made modifications may not be shown by the
  browsers as they may show an earlier version of the webpage with the same URL copied in the cache.

<P>The first line follows the HTTP/1.1 standard, while the second works under HTTP/1.0.

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Required libraries are included:
<PRE>
   require("config.inc");
   require("lib.inc");
   require("translation.inc");
   require("lang.inc");
   require("box.inc");
</PRE>

<P>These are the basic libraries for SourceWell. You can
find an explanation of them in the chapter where the files are exposed. The
functions they contain are explained later.

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Initializes the translation object

<PRE>
  $t = new translation($la);
</PRE>

<P>This is the constructor for the language object. It assures that on
every page the object is constructed properly. The value of the $la
variable gives the language in which the page will be shown.

<p>As we pretend to use gettext in the future, this translation object will be removed in the next versions.

  <P>&nbsp;<LI>database connection (if required in the page)

<P>SourceWell works in many pages (and in its menubar) with a database. At this point a persistent connection to the database is build. By using PHPLib's functions we expect to have database independence.

<PRE>
    $db = new DB_SourceWell;
</PRE>

<P>Note that for MySQL (SourceWell's only supported database up to the moment), this code is equivalent to build a persistent connection
like this:

<PRE>
    $db = mysql_pconnect($db_host,$db_name,$db_password);
</PRE>

  <P>&nbsp;<LI>Head of the page (HTML and BODY tags, metatags, title, css, fonts...)
  <BR>&nbsp;<LI>top strip and top title

<P>The top strip is a strip (one line table with 100% width) with some links at the
left side and the
actual value of the session (if logged in user name, permissions and
time to end session and if not logged in the string "not logged in") at the right one. You can personalize the links
at the right side in the config.inc file. The actual value of the session is
translated into the supported languages.

<P>The top title is another table (with 100% width) which has two images and the title and
 slogan of your website. You can configure this propperly in the
config.inc file.

  <BR>&nbsp;<LI>Menubar
<P>The menubar allows to easily navigate through the SourceWell system. It is
placed at the left side of your browser.

<P>The links shown depend on the
permissions of the visitor. If you look at the sections where the files in the
main directory are explained, you'll understand what this means. For instance,
while the menubar contains a link to "Login" for unauthenticated users,
authenticated users (that means users who have logged in) will instead get a
"Logout" link.

  <P>&nbsp;<LI>Opens table
<P>The content of each page is exposed in the table just opened. It will be
closed in the footer.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Initializes box objects
<P>The box objects that are used in the page are constructed at the
beginning. Usually you will find two boxes: bx and be. bx is the main
box while be is the error message box.

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Content of the page
  <UL>
  <BR><LI>permission if required
<P>Depending on the page, permissions will be required. For instance, if
we want a page only accessible for the <I>editors</I>, we will put
this code:

<PRE>
    if (!$perm->have_perm("editor"))
</PRE>

<P>In the case shown as an example, any other visitor who hasn't got <I>editor</I> permission will get an error message. This is only an example that is not really true. Instead of <I>editor</I>, you will find a variable such as <I>$config_perm_xxxx</I> (being <I>xxxx</I> the type of functionality, such as administrating sections, administrating the faq, etc.). That means that the permission needed to enter that page is set by this variable. This is done so allowing you to easily change the permission needed just by editing the include/config.inc file and modifying the permission requirements that should be met to access that page.

  <P>&nbsp;<LI> functionality of the page

<P>Here comes the real functionality of the page. For instance, the file for
registering as a new user (register.php3) contains here the code for doing a
registration.
  </UL>

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Footer

<P>The include/footer.inc file contains the common ending of almost all SourceWell pages. What the footer inserts in
each file is:

  <UL>
  <BR><LI>Close table
<P>The content table opened in the header.inc file is closed.

  <BR>&nbsp;<LI>Bottom strip
<P>The bottom strip (one line table with 100% width) gives the name of the Organisation which owns the
website. You can configure it to suit your needs in the config.inc file.

  <BR>&nbsp;<LI>Ending HTML and BODY tags
  </UL>

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Ending (saving) session
<P>The PHPLib page_close() function closes (saves) the session for this
page. In fact, the SourceWell developer does not have to worry about sessions
if he follows the exposed scheme. PHPLib will do the session-job transparently
for you. Nice ;-).

<A NAME="sourcewell_functions">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">9.3. SourceWell Functions

<P>If you're interested in further developing or in (re)using what is already
coded, this section will help you to rapidly know what is available.

<A NAME="box">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">9.3.1. Functions in box.inc

<P>The box class is defined to make tables easier to implement in
SourceWell. This functions are used in almost all files in the SourceWell system.

<p>This library is very useful, but has been shown to be too simple. We would like to improve it in the future.

<P CLASS="function">function box (...)

<PRE>
    function box ($box_width="",
	          $frame_color="#000000",
	          $frame_width="1",
	          $title_bgcolor="#CCCCCC",

	          $body_font_color="#000000",
	          $body_align="");
</PRE>

<P>Constructor. The given parameters are the parameters by default; any
other value will overwrite them.

<P CLASS="function">function box_begin()

<P>Begins the box. The box has to be constructed before with the box()
function. This function requires box_end() at the end.

<P CLASS="function">function box_end()

<P>Ends the box. Requires box_begin() to be defined before in order to end it.

<P CLASS="function">function box_title($title)

<P>This function allows you to put the string $title as title of the box. This
function should be placed after the box_begin() function.

<P CLASS="function">function box_full($title, $text)

<P>Given the strings title and text, the box is created. This type of
box is usefull when printing error messages. 

<P CLASS="function">function box_strip($title)

<P>This function allows you to have subtitles in boxes. This function is very
usefull when you have different classifications in the same box and want to
have a title header (strip) for each one. This functions requires the box to be
constructed with the box() function and to be beginned with box_begin().


<A NAME="cmtlib">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">9.3.2. Functions in cmtlib.inc

<P>The cmtlib library contains the functions needed for the supporting comments
on applications.

<P CLASS="function">function cmtform($query)

<P>Shows the form to be filled to give a comment on a certain application. The query parameter is a SQL query that looks in the software table for the
application with the given <I>id</I>. Applications that can be commented have
to be not <I>pending</I>.

<P CLASS="function">function cmtshow($query)

<P>Shows the comment given for an application. The query parameter is a SQL query with the information of the applications whose comments will be shown. If your aim is to  show all comments on a given application, this function has to be called several times.

<P CLASS="function">function cmtmod($query)

<P>This function is used by the <I>admin</I> to administrate comments. The query parameter is a SQL query with the information of the applications whose comments will be modified. While in cmtform($query) the fields are in blank,
this function returns the fields with the actual values stored in the database
as default entries to the form. 

<P CLASS="function">function faqshow($query)

<P>Shows the just inserted FAQ by the <I>admin</I>. The query parameter is a SQL query with the information of the faq being showed. For showing all the FAQs in the FAQ-page accessible to everybody (faq.php3), another algorithm is used (and that's why it appears differently), but you could use this one iteratively too with the same aim.

<P CLASS="function">function faqmod($query)

<P>This function is used by the <I>admin</I> to modify existing FAQs. While in faqform() the fields are in blank, this function returns the fields with the actual values stored in the database as default entries to the form. 

<P CLASS="function">function faqform()

<P>This function is used by the <I>admin</I> to insert new FAQs.

<A NAME="lib">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">9.3.3. Functions in lib.inc

<P>This is the main library. It contains all the functions that work with the
applications, its parameters and main functionality. This functions are used in
almost every SourceWell file.

<P CLASS="function">function mktimestamp($time)

<P>Returns the variable $timestamp. Transforms the time parameter
properly into a value accepted by the (MySQL) database.

<P>The use of timestamp in SourceWell's database gets a little clearer when we
read the MySQL Manual: "The TIMESTAMP column type provides a
type that you can use to automatically mark INSERT or UPDATE operations with
the current date and time. If you have multiple TIMESTAMP columns, only the
first one is updated automatically."

<P CLASS="function">function timestr($timestamp)

<P>Returns the variable $time. This function transforms the type timestamp
used in MySQL into the wanted output.

<P>It prints the date in this format: "%A, %e. %B %Y, %H:%M:%S %Z". An example
output could be: "Monday, 1. Jan 2001, 15:46:15 CET".

<P>SourceWell can translate the weekday and the month to the languages
supported by the system. In our example, "Monday" and "January" will appear only for the English version.

<P CLASS="function">function timestr_short($timestamp)

<P>Returns the variable $time. This function transforms the type timestamp
used in MySQL into the wanted output. This function is used in the
top_strip.inc file from the include subdirectory that comes at the beginning of
almost all SourceWell files. It prints the date in this
format: "%a,%e.%b,%H:%M:%S". An example output would be:
"Mon,1.Jan,15:46:15".

<P>SourceWell can translate the weekday and the month to the languages
supported by the system. In our example, "Mon" (that stays for Monday) and "Jan"
(that stays for January) will appear only for the English version.

<P CLASS="function">function timestr_comment($timestamp)

<P>Returns the variable $time. This function transforms the type timestamp
used in MySQL into the wanted output. This function is used to show the
creation date of application comments.

<P>The printed data format follows this rule: "%e. %b, %H:%M". An example
output could be:
"1. Jan, 15:46".

<P>SourceWell can translate the month to the languages
supported by the system. In our example, "Jan"
(that stays for January) will appear only for the English version.


<P CLASS="function">function appfull($query)

<P>Shows the whole information stored about an app. The query parameter is the SQL query. 

<P CLASS="function">function appcat($query,$title,$iter)

<P>Shows the apps in a certain category. query is the SQL database query that will be worked on. title puts the name of the
category as title of the table and iter allows to show the apps in
steps of 10 apps each time.

<P CLASS="function">function appdat($query)

<P>This function just calls the function appd($query).

<P CLASS="function">function appd($query)

<P>Displays application data. The query parameter is the SQL query.

<P CLASS="function">function appupdate($query)

<P>This function calls the function appd($query) and adds at the end a line with the current status of the application (pending, deleted or modified)

<P CLASS="function">function appday($start)

<P>Displays marginal application data. The start parameter gives the date
for which the applications should be displayed. All the SQL queries
and other things are done internally.

<P CLASS="function">function updform($query)

<P>Update form. The query parameter is the SQL query.

<P CLASS="function">function insform()

<P>Insert form. Displays the applications just inserted.

<P CLASS="function">function inssec($string)

<P>Insert category. The string parameter has to be set to "yes" when the
section is not in the categories table and has to be inserted.

<P CLASS="function">function seccat($selected_sec, $selected_cat)

<P>Displays the different section/category pairs as options of a HTML SELECT form. selected_sec and selected_cat are the section and category by default (the SELECTED attribute in the form).

<P CLASS="function">function sec($selected)

<P>Displays the different sections as options of a HTML SELECT form. selected is the section by default (the SELECTED attribute in the form).

<P CLASS="function">function license($selected)

<P>Displays the different licenses as options of a HTML SELECT form. row is the
license by default (the SELECTED attribute in the form).

<P CLASS="function">function urgency($int)

<P>Urgency is stored in the database as an integer. Given this integer as a parameter, the
urgency function returns the string equivalent.

<CENTER><TABLE width=40% border=0 cellspacing=0>
<TR><TD>Entered value</TD><TD>Urgency returns</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>$int = 1</TD><TD>"low"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>$int = 2</TD><TD>"medium"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>$int = 3</TD><TD>"high".</TD><TR>
<TR><TD colspan=2>The default value is "medium"</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P CLASS="function">function show_more($iter,$maxiter,$url, $urlquery)

<P>Shows apps of the current iteraction iter until it reaches ten or the
maximum number of iteractions maxiter. The url and urlquery parameters allow to go forward and/or backwards in order: url is just the php3 page that will be called and urlquery the rest of the URL query (the parameters that follow the "?" in the URL).

<P CLASS="function">function wrap($string,$width=75,$break=" ")

<P>This functions wraps the input $string at the characters given by $break
(which is by default a blank space) when the width of the string is greater
than $width (which is by default 75 characters long).

<P CLASS="function">function typestr($type)

<P>The type of an application is stored in the database as a single
character. Given this character as a parameter, the
typestr function returns the string equivalent.

<CENTER><TABLE width=40% border=0 cellspacing=0>
<TR><TD>Entered value</TD><TD>typestr returns</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>$type = "S"</TD><TD>"Stable"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>$type = "D"</TD><TD>"Development"</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>This function supports internally the translation function.

<P CLASS="function">function increasecnt($id, $type)

<P>Given the application id and the type of count (see table counter), this
function increases that type of count for that application in the database.

<P CLASS="function">function checkcnt($id, $ipaddr, $type)

<P>This function checks if the application (given by its id) has increased its
counting from the IP address (given by ipaddr) in the last day. The type gives
the type of count (see table counter).

<P>The table counter_check keeps track of all the countings made during the
last hours. This functions looks if the application has an entry from the actual
IP address in a counter type given by $type. If this occurs, the function increasecnt($id,
$type) will not be called avoiding malicious increasing of application importance.

<P CLASS="function">function nlmsg($period)

<P>This function shows the contents of the news mailing lists. The period parameter is a string whose value can be "weekly" for the
weekly mailing list or "daily" for the daily mailing list.

<P CLASS="function">function mailuser($perms, $subj, $message)

<P>Sends an e-mail message to the users with the <I>$perm</I> permission. The
content of the message is given by the <I>$message</I> parameter and its subject by
<I>$subj</I>. This function is used to give advice to editors when a new
application is inserted, deleted or changed (modified not!) and to give advice to
administrators when new users register.

<A NAME="statslib">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">9.3.4. Functions in statslib.inc

<P>The statslib library has been thought to develop the statistics for
SourceWell. The boxes are implemented internally, so the developer
only has to worry about the statistical implementation.

<P>This library has been
developed parallel to the box library, so you'll find common (and exclusive)
features in them. Future versions may try to make both libraries converge.

<P CLASS="function">function stats($result,$var,$message,$position)

<P>This function returns an ordered list (a sort of top list) for the variable <I>$var</I>. <I>$var</I> gives the type for which the table is shown
(app_cnt, sum_cnt, download_cnt, homepage_cnt, rpm_cnt, deb_cnt, tgz_cnt). <I>$result</I> is the database result for a given SQL
input. <I>$message</I> is the title of the table. The <I>$position</I>
parameter gives the starting position of the applications listed.

<P>It does not require any previous box or table definition as it
does this internally. The length of the graphic bar is also internally chosen.

<P CLASS="function">function stats_title($message)

<P>Displays the header of the table with the title given by $message. This function is
similar to the box_title($title) function defined in box.inc.

<P CLASS="function">function stats_subtitle($message)

<P>Used to insert subtitles in the table. This function is
similar to the box_strip($title) function defined in box.inc.

<P CLASS="function">function stats_display($what,$count,$url,$urlquery,$total)

<P>This function displays the statistics graphically in one row. <I>$what</I>
is a string with the name of what is displayed, <I>$count</I> gives the number of times it appears in the database, <I>$url</I> is the corresponding url (only the xxx.php3 url), <I>$urlquery</I> the rest of the URL (made so for achieving session managemente with and without cookies) and <I>$total</I> is the total number of implied applications. In the case <I>$url</I> or <I>$urlquery</I> are "0", the displayed statistics wont have a link.

<P CLASS="function">function stats_end()

<P>Finishes the table. This function is similar to the box_end() function defined in box.inc.


<A NAME="translation">
<P CLASS="subsubsubtitle">9.3.5. Functions in translation.inc

<P>This library is small, but very important. It has the translate
function which allows SourceWell to be supported in several languages.

<P CLASS="function">function translate($phrase)

<P>Returns $tmp. phrase is a parameter that contains the string in
SourceWell's native language, English. The returned value, $tmp, will
be the string in the translated language. The translate function belongs to the
translation object. On every SourceWell page, at the header, the variable $t is
an initialization (construction) of this object.


<A NAME="translations_for_developers">
<P CLASS="subsubtitle">9.4. Supporting translations

<P>The way the translation works is very simple. SourceWell's outputs are
written by default in English, but there's an implemented
function (the translate($phrase) function) that <I>translates</I> these outputs to
other languages. In the include subdirectory, you'll find the files that are
responsible for this miracle: the <I>Language</I>-lang.inc. These files contain
the English to <I>Language</I> translations and help the translate($phrase)
function with its work.

<P>The translation procedure is very simple. Every page in SourceWell has a
translation object constructed that is ready for use. This object, whose
variable is <I>$t</I> contains a function which will be called for every string
that should be translated.

<P>It's better understood with an example. Imagine you would like to have the
string <I>Home</I> be able to be translated in other languages other than
English. For a normal output, we would write this code:

<PRE>
      echo "Home";
</PRE>

<P>When wanting to be able to have it translated, we will call the explained
translation function of the $t object. Coded:

<PRE>
      echo $t->translate("Home");
</PRE>

<P>The translation function will see first what language the user has chosen and
then return the string in $temp that corresponds to "Home" for that language.
That means that if the visitor has
chosen the German language, you will get this in your web browser as the output
of the upper code:

<PRE>
      Heim
</PRE>

<P>And
that's it. You'll have noticed how simple it is to support internationalization
for SourceWell!

<P>&nbsp;
<A NAME="version_numbering">
<P CLASS="subtitle">10. Version numbering policy

<P>SourceWell versions will follow this pattern:
<I>a</I>.<I>b</I>.<I>c</I>. While <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> can only be integers,
<I>c</I> can be either an integer or a character.

<UL>
<LI><I>a</I> will be increased when the SourceWell system has new,
innovative concepts.
<BR>Updating your actual SourceWell system is then not
only recommended... it's a must!

<BR>&nbsp;<LI><I>b</I> is increased when inserting major bug fixes, major security fixes, a big amount of
further developing or new relevant features.
<BR>Updating your SourceWell system is
recommended.

<BR>&nbsp;<LI><I>c</I> is increased when inserting minor bug fixes, minor
security fixes, a small amount of
further developing or a new language support. <I>c</I> is optional if it is
cero. It will become a character
in steps of five. That means for example that
<UL>
<LI>SourceWell 1.0a = SourceWell 1.0.5 and that
<LI>SourceWell 2.3c = SourceWell 2.3.15
</UL>
<BR>Updating your SourceWell system is not required if you do not need the incorporated functionality.
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;
<A NAME="faq">
<P CLASS="subtitle">11. FAQ

<UL>
<LI>When should I use PHP-Nuke and when SourceWell?
<BR>PHP-Nuke and SourceWell have been implemented for two different
purposes. While PHP-Nuke is a news system portal, SourceWell is
thought to be an announcement and retrieval system, where the
announced items (in our case software) are more important than user
interaction between themselves. Our recomendation then is: use PHP-Nuke if you
want to make your site a meeting point about a certain topic
and use SourceWell if you want to announce propperly items. 

<P>&nbsp;<LI>Is SourceWell database independent?
<BR>The answer is yes. SourceWell uses PHPLib's functions to access the database, so every database supported by PHPLib should also support the SourceWell system. Up to now, we've only tested SourceWell in BerliOS with MySQL.

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>Does SourceWell work with PHP4?
<BR>Theoretically yes. Please report the authors if you have got any problems.

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>Can an anonymous user add software and do comments?
<BR>If you wish so, yes; you just have to create an user with <I>anonymous</I> permissions (the default system comes with one anonymous user as you'll quickly find out). There can be only one user with that permission and this user can't have any other permissions.
<BR>If you don't wish to have an anonymous user, just make sure that your system hasn't got any user with <I>anonymous</I> permission in admuser.php3. SourceWell will then only accept software insertions, software modifications and comments by registered users (with <I>user</I> permission).

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>Does a mailing list for developers interested in SourceWell exist?
<BR>Yes. Just write it down: <a href="mailto:sourcewell-support@lists.berlios.de">sourcewell-support@lists.berlios.de</a>.

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>Why is SourceWell not in my language?
<BR>SourceWell can be easily translated into different languages. If you see
that SourceWell does not have support in your language, you're gladly invited to help us with the internationalization. Visit <a href="http://sourcewell.berlios.de/html/translating.php3" target="_blank">http://sourcewell.berlios.de/html/translating.php3</a>.

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>What the hell does <I>importance</I> mean?
<BR>Importance is the sum of all the different counts of an application. That
means, that importance adds the number of hits on an app plus the number of
downloads (tarballs, RPMs, DEBs and TGZs) and the number of redirected changelogs,
CVSs, screenshots and mailing list archives. We think it is an interesting
manner of measuring the visitor's interest on applications.

<P>&nbsp;
<LI>What is BerliOS?
<BR>BerliOS is the German national OpenSource Center. BerliOS offers web
information, documentation, information events, consultancy + further
developments, sector-specific solutions, software-solutions + new versions,
searchengines and successfull debut in the world of OpenSource Software.
