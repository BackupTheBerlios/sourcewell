Fast installation guide

(These paragraphs are taken from the SourceWell documentation point 3.1)

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3, PHPLib and MySQL installed in your system.


* user$ mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
  (insert superuser_password)
* mysql> USE mysql;
* mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'operator', PASSWORD('operator_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
* mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* mysql> CREATE DATABASE sourcewell;
* mysql> exit;
* user$ tar -zxvf sourcewell-1.0.tar.gz
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < sourcewell/sql/sw.sql
  (insert the operator_password)
* user$ vi sourcewell/include/local.inc
  (insert the correct database parameters; please, keep sourcewell as the database name)

   var $Host     = "host";
   var $Database = "sourcewell";
   var $User     = "operator";
   var $Password = "password";

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
SourceWell. Start your browser and visit
http://yourserver/sourcewell/index.php3. As you'll see, SourceWell
comes with some inserted example applications and licenses. You can
delete or modify them by entering as an administrator. To do so, login
as the default administrator with user,editor,admin permissions.
At the prompt use the following ID to login (case sensitive):

        Username: oldfish
	Password: oldfish


Vert important: Be sure of inmediately changing the login and password by
clicking on the User Admin link. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)

If things do not work, maybe you'll have to read the whole
installation chapter from the SourceWell documentation.
