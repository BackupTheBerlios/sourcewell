	* include/Field.inc: class has been made PHPLib independent. Other
	  database access pending.

	* include/config.inc: added database configuration parameters to the
 	  configuration file. A new variable can also be set to put the variable
          that will have the database link.
	  This is needed to make the classes independent from this name

	* include/config.inc: added configuration parameter to include classes
          and libraries easily

	* include/Field.inc: replaced column width with configuration parameter

	* include/config.inc: the width for the Form classes can be set up here
	  with config_*ColumnWidth variables

	* include/config.inc: configuration variable $config_PHPLib_installed
 	  added. This will make all our classes have the possibility to be
	  PHPLib independent
        * include/config.inc: all variables in the config file start with config_
