<h1>The BSD License</h1>

<blockquote>

<p>The following is a BSD license template. To generate your own license,
change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original
values as given here, and substitute your own.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The advertising clause in the license appearing on BSD Unix
files was officially <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change">
rescinded</a> by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of
the University of California on July 22 1999. He states that clause 3 is
"hereby deleted in its entirety."</p>

<p>Note the new BSD license is thus equivalent to the <a
href="mit-license.html">MIT License</a>, except for the no-endorsement
final clause.</p>

"COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read "REGENTS
