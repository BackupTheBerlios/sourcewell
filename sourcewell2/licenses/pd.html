<h1>Public Domain</h1>

<p>If you release your package to the public domain, anyone can do whatever
they like with it.
<p>There's no license, which avoids the need for disclaimers etc. However,
you should declare unambiguously that you have released it to the public
domain.
<p>Here's how you can do it, in a way that incorporates "gentle persuasion"
to encourage users of the package to propagate their enhancements back
into the Eiffel community:
<ul>
<li>
Put the following text into a file public.txt within your distribution:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 BGCOLOR="#FFFFC9" >
<tr>
<td>This package is released to the public domain.
<p>If you modify it, you are strongly encouraged to publicly release the
modified version.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Near the top of each class file (or other item within the package), and
in any announcements about the package, and in any application "splash
screen" or "about box", include the following line:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 BGCOLOR="#FFFFC9" >
<tr>
<td>Released to the public domain by &lt;your-name>, see file "public.txt"</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
</tt>
