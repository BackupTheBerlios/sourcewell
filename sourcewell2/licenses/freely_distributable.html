<H1>Freely Distributable</h1>

<tt>
<p>Freely distributable does not mean the same thing as PD
(public domain).  A big portion of the software available here is not
in the public domain, although it is freely distributable.  Many are
copyrighted by some person or organization, but can be distributed
freely; there may be limitations on the manner of distribution and/or
the usage of the programs.  There may also be certain rules concerning
the distribution of modified versions (derivate work) of the programs,
like saying that if you redistribute a modified version you must
include in the distribution the date and author of the modification.
Also on many programs you must include a note crediting the original
author of the program if you use his code in your own programs.
