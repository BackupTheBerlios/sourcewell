Fast Installation Guide
-----------------------

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3/4, PHPLib and MySQL installed on your system.

Install the sourcewell archive in a subdirectory of the 
documents root directory of your web server.

Use the installation scripts which guides you through the
installation process. Start your browser with the URL:

http://yourserver/sourcewell/install.php

and follow the instructions.

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
SourceWell. Start your browser and visit

http://yourserver/sourcewell/

If everything looks ok, great! As you'll see in the index page, the SourceWell system comes with some inserted example applications and licenses. You can
delete or modify them by entering as an administrator. To do so, login
as the default administrator with user,editor,admin permissions.
At the prompt use the following username and password to login (case sensitive):

        Username: admin
	Password: admin


Very important: Be sure that you immediately change the username and password by
clicking on the Change User link. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)

Note: Translation support needs a lot of memory. We're looking for a better memory management for the translation function. If this is an important feature for you, think changing the php3.ini allowed memory input. You should change the default line:
memory_limit = 8388608; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)  

with this one:
memory_limit = 33554432; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (32MB)
